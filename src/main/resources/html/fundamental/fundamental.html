    <h2>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
    <p>
        HTTP is the protocol that allows web servers and browsers to exchange data over the web. It is a request and response protocol.
        The client requests a file and the server responds to the request. HTTP uses reliable TCP connections by default on TCP port 80.
    </p>
    <p>
        In HTTP, it's always the client who initiates a transaction by establishing a connection and sending an HTTP request.
        The server is in no position to contact a client or make a callback connection to the client.
