    <h1>Servlet Filtering</h1>
    <hr class="my-4" />

    <p class="text-justify">
        Filters are new in the Servlet 2.3 specification, enabling you to intercept a request before it reaches a resource. In other
        words, a filter gives you access to the HttpServletRequest and the HttpServletResponse objects before they are passed in to
        a servlet.
    </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
        Filters can be very useful. For example, you can write a filter that records all incoming requests and logs the IP addresses
        of the computers from which the requests originate. You also can use a filter as an encryption and decryption device. Other
        uses include user authentication, data compression, user input validation, and so on.
