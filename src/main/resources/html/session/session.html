    <h1>Session Management</h1>

    <p>
        The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the network protocol that web servers and client browsers use to communicate
        with each other. HTTP is the language of the web. HTTP connections are initiated by a client browser that sends an HTTP
        request. The web server then responds with an HTTP response and closes the connection. If the same client requests another
        resource from the server, it must open another HTTP connection to the server. The server always closes the connection as
        soon as it sends the response, whether or not the browser user needs some other resource from the server.

        You will use four techniques for session management. They operate based on the same principle, although what is passed and
        how it is passed is different from one to another. The techniques are as follows:

        <ol>
            <li>URL rewriting</li>
            <li>Hidden fields</li>
            <li><a href="/cookie">Cookies</a></li>
            <li>Session objects</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
