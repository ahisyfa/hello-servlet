    <h1>Cookie</h1>

    <p>
        A cookie is a small piece of information that
        is passed back and forth in the HTTP request and response. Even though a cookie can be created on the client side using some
        scripting language such as JavaScript, it is usually created by a server resource, such as a servlet. The cookie sent by a servlet
        to the client will be passed back to the server when the client requests another page from the same application.
